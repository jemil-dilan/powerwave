# PowerWave Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed and Kept

### 1. Currency Symbol Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Currency symbol was displaying as `262145` instead of `$`
- **Solution**: Fixed the `formatPrice()` function to use a reliable hard-coded `$` symbol
- **Result**: All prices now display correctly (e.g., `$99.99`, `$1,234.56`)

### 2. Cart Empty Display - FIXED ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Empty cart was showing `$0.00` which looked confusing
- **Solution**: Created `getCartTotalForDisplay()` function that shows empty string for empty cart
- **Result**: Empty cart now shows no price, populated cart shows correct total

### 3. Original Website Styling - RESTORED ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Comprehensive styling solutions were interfering with original design
- **Solution**: Removed all additional CSS files and styling modifications
- **Result**: Website displays with original styling, looks exactly as before
